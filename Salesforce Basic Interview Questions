  LookUp Relationship :It is a loosely coupled relationship among Salesforce objects, where  even if a parent record gets deleted, the child records 
                       remain in the system. Here, both the parent and child have their own sharing settings and security controls.
                       
  Master Details Relationship :It is a strongly coupled relationship among Salesforce objects, which means if a master record gets deleted, then the child
                              records associated with it are also deleted.Both doesn't have their own setting.security setting of a parent object applies to the child object.

6)  What is permission set in Salesforce ?
    A permission set is a collection of settings and permissions that give users access to various tools and functions.
    Users can have only one profile but,depending on the Salesforce edition, they can have multiple permission sets.
   
   Examples: 
   1.We have many users in your organization with some fundamental job functions.We can assign all of then with one profile that grants
   them all access to do their job. But some set of people are working on special apps or some special functionality, for this type of 
   special users we can create permission sets and can be assigned to them.

  2.Some users need some temporary access to a specific set of fields and objects we can create a permission set with those object & field 
    access and we can assign those specific users.
