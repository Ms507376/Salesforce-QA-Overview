1)What were the biggest testing challenges in your Salesforce project?   
●   Complex security and sharing rules
●   Multiple automations on the same object 
●   Different behavior for different profiles
●   Tight release timelines

2)  How did you ensure test coverage for complex Salesforce configurations?      
   I mapped test cases to:
   ●     Profiles and roles 
   ●     Automation 
   ●     Reports and dashboards 
   ●     Security settings 
   This helped ensure full coverage.

3) Have you tested record types and dependent picklists? Explain.
    Yes. I tested by creating records using each record type and verified correct picklist values based on dependencies.
    Opportunity - ( national record type , Local record type) 

4) How did you test custom objects and fields?
   I verified 
  ● Field creation and validations
  ● Permissions 
  ● Page layouts 
  ● Relationships

5) How did you test page layouts for different profiles? 
   I logged in as different users and verified field visibility, required fields, and available buttons.

6) Have you tested Lightning Record Pages? What issues did you find?
   Yes. Common issues were:
  ● Components not visible for some profiles
  ● Incorrect visibility filters 
  ● Performance issues

7) How did you test field-level security and object permissions?
   I tested with different profiles and permission sets to verify read, create, edit, and delete access.

8)  How did you validate role hierarchy and sharing rules?
    I tested record access by logging in as users at different role levels.

9) Have you tested permission sets? In what scenarios?
    Yes. I tested permission sets to give additional access without changing profiles.

10) How did you handle user access issues in production?      
    I analyzed profile, permission sets, and sharing rules, and worked with admins to resolve issues quickly.

11) What security-related defects did you find?      
    Some users could see or edit records they should not.These were fixed by correcting Field level security and sharing rules.

12) Have you tested Salesforce workflow ?
   Yes (i.e. Workflow Email Alert -> Goal (Send an email when an Opportunity Amount > 10,000))
   Step 1: Create Email Template with Subject High Value Opportunity
   Step 2: Create Workflow Rule ( object - Opportunity)
          Evaluation Criteria:Created
          Rule Criteria: opportunity Amount greater than 10000
  Step 3: Add Workflow Action
          Action Type: Email Alert
          Email Template: High Value Opportunity
          Recipient:Your user email (for testing)
   Activate the workflow( mandatory)

   Step 4: Test It
          Create a new Opportunity
          Set: Opportunity Amount = 15,000
          Save
   ✅ Expected Result: we should receive the email

 ❌ Negative Test:
    Create Opportunity with opportunity Amount =5,000
    No email should be sent

13) How did you test approval processes end-to-end?      
     I tested submission(Submit for approval),approval(Getting approved by approver),rejection,email alerts,
     and final record updates(Approved/accepted by client/Rejected by client)

14) How did you test reports and dashboards?      
    I validated filters, record counts, and summary values.

15) Have you tested dynamic dashboards? What challenges did you face?     
    Yes.The main challenge was data visibility changing based on user roles.

16 ) What reporting issues did you commonly find?  
     ●Incorrect filters ● Missing fields ● Wrong record counts

17) How did you perform regression testing in Salesforce?      
    I tested core business flows, automation, reports, and security after every deployment.

18) How did you handle Salesforce seasonal releases?     
    I tested standard features, Lightning UI, and custom components after release.

19) How did you reproduce production issues in sandbox?
    I matched production data, profiles, and permissions as closely as possible in uat.
   
20) How did you handle production defects? 
     I analyzed the issue,then reproduced it in UAT, tested the fix, and then validated in production.

21) What was the most critical production issue you handled?
    A security issue where users could access restricted records.It was fixed quickly by correcting sharing rules.

22) How did you handle tight deadlines?      
    I prioritized critical flows and focused on high-risk areas.

23) How do you test a user story when acceptance criteria are missing?    
     I derive acceptance criteria from: ● User story description ● Business process ●Existing Salesforce behavior
     Then I confirm assumptions with the business before final testing.

24) How do you handle last-minute requirement changes before release?   
     I analyze the impact,prioritize critical scenarios,update test cases,and perform focused regression testing. I clearly communicate risks to stakeholders.

25 ) How do you ensure full test coverage in Salesforce projects? 
     I cover: Functional testing ● Profiles and permissions ● Automation (Flows, workflows) ● Reports and dashboards ●Integration and security 
     I also map test cases to the requirements.

26 ) How do you test custom objects created by the admin?    
     I verify: ● Object permissions  ● Fields and validations ● Page layouts  and reports related to the object

27) A user can’t see records they should access. How do you troubleshoot?
    I check: ● Object permissions ● Record ownership ● Sharing rules ● Role hierarchy ●Organization-wide defaults

28) A user can edit a record they should only view. How do you test this issue?   
     I verify: ● Profile edit permissions ●Permission sets ●Field-level security ●Sharing access

29) How do you test permission sets without affecting other users?      
    I assign permission sets to test users only and validate access changes without modifying profiles.

30) Users complain Salesforce is slow. What will you check?      
    I check: ● Page load time ● Large reports ● Automation impact ● Browser issues.

31) What best practices do you follow as a Salesforce tester?
   ● Understand business processes. ●Test with different profile  ●Focus on automation and security ●Maintain clear test documentation

----------------------------Salesforce Testing Web Application Scenario-Based Questions------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) A user can log in but cannot see any records. How will you troubleshoot?
    I check the user’s profile and object permissions (Read access). Then I verify field-level security,record ownership,role hierarchy,and sharing rules. 
    I also check if the records are filtered out by list view filters.

2) Login works in Classic but fails in Lightning. What could be the reasons?
   ● Lightning access not enabled for the profile ● Browser compatibility or cache issue ● User does not have access to Lightning apps.

3) User gets an “Insufficient Privileges” error. How do you identify the issue? 
   I check:
   ● Object and field permissions ● Record ownership ● Sharing rules ●Whether the user is trying to access restricted features or records.

4) Fields appear correctly for one profile but not for another. How do you test this? 
   I compare Field-Level Security (FLS) and page layout assignments for both profiles.I log in as each user to confirm visibility and edit access.

5) A button is visible but not clickable. What checks will you perform?
    1️⃣ Check the record status
       See if the record is closed, approved, or locked.
       Some buttons don’t work when a record is in a certain status.

    2️⃣ Check user permissions
        Make sure the user has:Edit / Create permission on the object and Access to required fields
        If the user doesn’t have permission, the button can appear but won’t work.

    3️⃣ Check page layout
        Confirm the correct page layout is assigned to the user’s profile and record type, and the button is added properly.

    In short :I will check record status, user permissions, page layout and record type, approval locks, validation rules, 
    and if it’s a custom button, I’ll check the button logic.


6)  Records are saved without mandatory data — How to identify the issue?
      1️⃣ Check field-level required setting
          Go to Object → Fields and see if the field is actually marked Required.
          Sometimes it looks mandatory on the page, but isn’t required at field level.

      In short :I check whether the field is truly required at field level or only on the page layout,verify how the record is created (UI or backend),
      and review validation rules and automation that might bypass or clear the value.

7 ) User cannot edit a record they own. What could be wrong?  
    Possible reasons: ● The profile does not have Edit permission ● The record is locked by approval ●Validation rules blocking updates.

8) Flow not triggering on record update — How to test and debug?
    a) Check flow activation
        Make sure the flow is Active and not an old inactive version.

    b) Check entry conditions
       Confirm the field values actually change and meet the flow conditions.
       Flows won’t run if conditions aren’t met.

    c) Check if it’s before-save or after-save
        Before-save: runs only when record is updated directly
        After-save: required if flow updates related records

   Test using Debug
     Open the flow → Click Debug
     Update a record that meets the criteria
     See where the flow stops or skips

   Check for errors in logs
     Enable Debug Logs for the user and update the record.
     Look for flow or automation errors.

9) Email alerts are sent multiple times for one action. What could cause this?
   Possible causes: ● Duplicate workflow rules ● Flow looping ● Multiple automation tools acting on same event.

10) Data Loader upload fails with errors. How do you identify the root cause?
    I analyze: ● Error logs ● Field mappings ●Required fields ●Data format issues.

11) User sees blank report data while others see data. Why?  
    Because of sharing rules, role hierarchy, or report folder access.

12)Record visible via report but not via list view. Why?      
   List view filters or list view sharing settings may be incorrect.

13)Hotfix deployed directly to production. What should you test immediately?
   I test: ● Affected functionality ● Related automation ● Smoke and sanity checks.

14 ) User reports an issue that QA never saw. How do you reproduce it? 
     I collect user steps, profile details, browser info, and data conditions.
     Using those details try to reproduce it.

--------------------------------------------------------Salesforce Testing Q and A-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) How is Salesforce testing different from normal web application testing?  
   Salesforce testing focuses more on CRM features, data security, profiles, roles, automationautomation(work flow),and reports, while normal web testing mainly checks UI,
   functionality, and performance.

2)What are the key components a Salesforce tester must validate?
  A Salesforce tester must validate objects, fields, page layouts,profiles, roles,sharing rules,automation(work flow),reports, dashboards, and integrations.

3)What challenges are unique to Salesforce testing? 
  Some unique challenges are frequent releases, a complex security model,and limited access to backend code.

4) How do you validate organization-wide defaults (OWD)?       
   I set OWD to Private or Public and verify record access for different users.

5) How do you test validation rules?  
   I enter invalid data to confirm error messages and valid data to ensure the record saves successfully.

6) A user can see a record but should not be able to edit it. How do you handle this?
   I will give the user read-only access. This can be done by changing object permissions on the profile or by using a Permission Set
   with Read access only. If record-level control is needed, I can also use Sharing Settings with read-only access.

7) A user needs access to a field only for one week. What is the best solution?
    I will give access using a Permission Set and remove it after one week.Permission Sets are best for temporary access because they do not affect the profile.

8) Managers should see subordinates’ records, but peers should not. How do you configure this?
    I will use Role Hierarchy. Managers will be placed above their team members, so they can see subordinate records, 
     while peers at the same role level cannot see each other’s records.

9) A user needs temporary admin-level access. How do you provide it safely?   
   I will assign an Admin Permission Set for a limited time and remove it once the work is done.

10) Multiple users need access to one extra object without changing profiles. What will you do?
    I will create a Permission Set with access to that object and assign it to all required users.

11)A user should see all records but edit only their own. How do you configure this?  
   I will set Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) to Public Read Only and give users Edit access only to their own records using sharing rules.

12)What is a hierarchical relationship? 
   Hierarchical relationship is used only on the User object.It shows reporting structure like Manager → Employee.

13) How do we create relationship fields ? or from which object we create relationship fields ?   
     Relationship fields are created on the child object.       
     Example: Contact has a lookup to Account.

14) Are we allowed to convert lookup relationship to master detail relationship??
     Yes, but only if conditions are met: 
     ● No existing data issues ●Lookup field is mandatory ● Child records have parent values

15 ) Are we allowed to create a roll-up summary or mimic roll-up summary functionality on a lookup relationship? 
      No, Salesforce does not support it directly.But we can mimic it using: ● Flow ●Apex Trigger ● Declarative Rollup Summary tools.

16) What are record-level access methods?   
    Record-level access is controlled using: ● Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) ●Role Hierarchy ● Sharing Rules ●Manual Sharing

17) What are organization-wide defaults (OWD)? What is the difference between private, public read only and public read/write in OWD settings?
    OWD defines the default access level users have to records they do not own.
    ●Private: Only owner and higher roles can access. 
    ●Public Read Only: Others can view but not edit. ● Public Read/Write: Others can view and edit.
