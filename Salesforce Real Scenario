1)What were the biggest testing challenges in your Salesforce project?   
●   Complex security and sharing rules
●   Multiple automations on the same object 
●   Different behavior for different profiles
●   Tight release timelines

2)  How did you ensure test coverage for complex Salesforce configurations?      
   I mapped test cases to:
   ●     Profiles and roles 
   ●     Automation 
  ●     Reports and dashboards 
  ●     Security settings 
   This helped ensure full coverage.
