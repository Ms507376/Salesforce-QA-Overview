1)What were the biggest testing challenges in your Salesforce project?   
●   Complex security and sharing rules
●   Multiple automations on the same object 
●   Different behavior for different profiles
●   Tight release timelines

2)  How did you ensure test coverage for complex Salesforce configurations?      
   I mapped test cases to:
   ●     Profiles and roles 
   ●     Automation 
   ●     Reports and dashboards 
   ●     Security settings 
   This helped ensure full coverage.

3) Have you tested record types and dependent picklists? Explain.
    Yes. I tested by creating records using each record type and verified correct picklist values based on dependencies.
    Opportunity - ( national record type , Local record type) 

4) How did you test custom objects and fields?
   I verified 
  ● Field creation and validations
  ● Permissions 
  ● Page layouts 
  ● Relationships

5) How did you test page layouts for different profiles? 
   I logged in as different users and verified field visibility, required fields, and available buttons.

6) Have you tested Lightning Record Pages? What issues did you find?
   Yes. Common issues were:
  ● Components not visible for some profiles
  ● Incorrect visibility filters 
  ● Performance issues

7) How did you test field-level security and object permissions?
   I tested with different profiles and permission sets to verify read, create, edit, and delete access.

8)  How did you validate role hierarchy and sharing rules?
    I tested record access by logging in as users at different role levels.

9) Have you tested permission sets? In what scenarios?
    Yes. I tested permission sets to give additional access without changing profiles.

10) How did you handle user access issues in production?      
    I analyzed profile, permission sets, and sharing rules, and worked with admins to resolve issues quickly.

11) What security-related defects did you find?      
    Some users could see or edit records they should not.These were fixed by correcting Field level security and sharing rules.

12) Have you tested Salesforce workflow ?
   Yes (i.e. Workflow Email Alert -> Goal (Send an email when an Opportunity Amount > 10,000))
   Step 1: Create Email Template with Subject High Value Opportunity
   Step 2: Create Workflow Rule ( object - Opportunity)
          Evaluation Criteria:Created
          Rule Criteria: opportunity Amount greater than 10000
  Step 3: Add Workflow Action
          Action Type: Email Alert
          Email Template: High Value Opportunity
          Recipient:Your user email (for testing)
   Activate the workflow( mandatory)

   Step 4: Test It
          Create a new Opportunity
          Set: Opportunity Amount = 15,000
          Save
   ✅ Expected Result: we should receive the email
